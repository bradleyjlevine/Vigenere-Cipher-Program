# Vigenere-Cipher-Program
This was a project assigned in Computer Security.  My partner was Dakota Findley.
This has two programs:
  Vigenere:
    This can encrypt and decrypt a text document using Vigenere cipher.
  Attack:
    This is a cryptanalysis program for breaking Vigenere ciphertexts.  This uses the index of coincidence to break it.
